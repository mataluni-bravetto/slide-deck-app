    title: 'From AI Chaos to {gold}Calm Convergence{/gold}',
    subtitle: '30 Days to a Stable, Aligned Dev Workflow',
    insight: "In the next 70 minutes, you'll leave with one pattern that transforms how you use AI—calmer, more reliable, YAGNI-compliant. Everything today is usable even if you never buy anything.",
  },

    title: 'You Are the {gold}Builder{/gold}, Not the Bot',
    subtitle: 'AI Is Just Part of Your Stack',
    body: 'You ship products. You own decisions. You design systems. AI is just another powerful dependency—nothing more, nothing less.',
    insight: 'Hero positioning: You are the protagonist of this story. AI is a tool in your toolkit, not a replacement for your judgment.',
  },

    id: 'unified-3',
    phase: 'CLARIFY',
    preTitle: 'A confession',
    title: 'Developers Hate {gold}Monorepos{/gold}…',
    subtitle: 'Yet They Powered Every Breakthrough I Shipped',
    body: 'I resisted strict architecture because it felt heavy and restrictive. Over time, those constraints created clarity, reuse, and velocity on complex systems.',
    insight: 'AI today feels scattered and noisy. The right single pattern can turn something annoying into your biggest leverage—just like a well-structured monorepo.',
  },

      "Less clarity about what's actually happening",
      'Broken flow from context-switching between tools',
      "Debugging AI mistakes takes longer than writing it yourself"

    title: 'AI Generates Faster Than You Can {gold}Reason{/gold}',
    subtitle: 'Your Brain Drowns in Options',
    body: 'Models emit pages of code in seconds. Humans can\'t audit that volume at the same speed. The result: cognitive overload, decision fatigue, and \'I\'ll just do it myself\' frustration.',
    insight: 'The issue is mismatch of speeds, not lack of intelligence. A 200-line function dump vs a clean, constrained diff—that\'s the difference.',

    title: 'Tools Obey Rules. Partners {gold}Align{/gold} With You.',
    subtitle: 'From Commands → Relationship',
    body: 'Traditional tools have fixed behavior—you learn the API and that\'s it. Relational AI behavior changes based on your ongoing inputs, history, and constraints. This isn\'t sentience; it\'s pattern-matching over the relationship you create.',
    insight: 'Reframe usage from \'shouting prompts\' to \'training a collaborator inside each session.\' This prepares you for the Convergence Loop.',

    subtitle: 'No Emotion • Only Patterns',
    body: 'People read tone into model responses: \'it sounds annoyed\' or \'dismissive.\' But it\'s just autocomplete over text. There is no intention. Once you stop personalizing, you free up emotional bandwidth to reason clearly.',
    insight: 'Especially for neurodivergent devs who may be more sensitive to perceived tone—this reframe is liberating. The model has no opinion about you.',

    subtitle: 'One Goal • One Loop • One Source of Truth',
    body: 'Walk through a real dev task: \'Add feature X behind a flag.\' You write intention + constraints first. You keep a single source-of-truth message. Every AI call references that spec—no wandering.',
    insight: 'Contrast with chaos: many unrelated prompts, partial context, endless backtracking. YAGNI: no agents, no complex orchestration—just one clean loop.',

    subtitle: 'Less Noise • More Control • Clearer Thinking',
    body: 'How did that feel compared to your usual AI usage? What was different when you wrote constraints first? The problem was never \'AI is bad.\' It was \'AI without a convergence loop.\'',
    insight: 'You just experienced the difference. This closes the disorienting dilemma and anchors the new belief.',

    title: 'You Can {gold}Stop Here{/gold}. You Already Won.',
    subtitle: 'You Have the Pattern • You Have the Exercise',
    body: 'If all you do is take this loop and run with it solo, you\'ll already be ahead of 90% of AI users. This preserves trust and sets up what comes next as optional acceleration—not salvation.',
    insight: 'Everything valuable has already been given. What follows is for those who want supported implementation.',

      'Bugs slip into production unnoticed',
      'Debugging takes longer than writing it yourself',
      'Trust erodes with each failure'
