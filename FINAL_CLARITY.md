## MESSAGING FOR YOUR TEAM

### When They Ask "What's the Difference?"

**"Convergence Sprint is a one-time $497 methodology program. You learn the Convergence Loop pattern in 30 days, then you own it forever. It's different from AI Guardian Suite, which is our $99/month AI safety platform (BiasGuard, TokenGuard, TrustGuard, ContextGuard, SecurityGuard, plus PrivacyGuard and HealthGuard). They're complementary—Sprint teaches you HOW to guide AI effectively, Guardian provides ongoing AI safety and optimization services. Different products, different pricing, different purposes. Use Sprint to master the pattern. Use Guardian for ongoing protection."**

### Key Talking Points
1. **Different Products:** Sprint = methodology (pattern), Guardian Suite = AI safety platform (7 services)
2. **Different Pricing:** Sprint = one-time $497, Guardian Suite = monthly $99
3. **Different Purpose:** Sprint = pattern implementation (HOW), Guardian Suite = ongoing AI safety services (WHAT)
4. **Complementary:** Sprint teaches you to guide AI, Guardian protects your AI systems

## FOUNDER'S LAUNCH CLARITY

### What "Founder's Launch" Means
- **Limited Spots:** Only 50 spots at $497

### Why "Founder's Launch" vs "AI Guardian Suite"
- **Different Product:** Convergence Sprint is methodology, not AI Guardian Suite
- **Different Pricing:** One-time ($497) vs monthly ($99)
- **Different Purpose:** Pattern implementation (HOW) vs ongoing AI safety services (WHAT)
- **Different Audience:** Developers who want to master the pattern vs developers/teams who need ongoing AI safety
