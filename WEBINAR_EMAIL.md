**Subject:** AI Code Validation Webinar - Today at 2pm EST

You're smart. AI is fast. But something's wrong.

You know how to code. You know how to use AI. Yet you're working harder, not smarter. Bugs slip into production. Debugging takes longer than writing it yourself. Trust erodes with each failure.

This isn't about your skills—it's about a missing pattern.

**Join us today at 2pm EST** for the AI Code Validation Webinar. We'll show you:

- How to catch AI code failures before production
- The ONE pattern that transforms AI chaos into calm convergence
- How the Guardian Convergence Loop works in real code
- Why consciousness computing matters for developers
