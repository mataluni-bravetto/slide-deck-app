## 🔍 HOW TO FIND YOUR METRICS

### **If Reports Are in Files:**
1. Search for keywords: "accuracy", "performance", "benchmark", "results"
2. Look for numbers: percentages, milliseconds, sample counts
3. Find summary sections or executive summaries

### **If Reports Are in Code:**
1. Look for test files: `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`
2. Check for benchmark scripts
3. Look for validation results in JSON/CSV files

### **If Reports Are in Documentation:**
1. Check `docs/validation/` directory
2. Look for markdown files with "report", "validation", "test" in name
3. Check README files in validation toolkit directories

## 🚀 QUICK INTEGRATION

**Once you provide metrics, I'll:**

1. ✅ Update sales deck slides with validated claims
2. ✅ Add confidence intervals where available
3. ✅ Include "12 months of testing" messaging
4. ✅ Reference "dozens of reports" where appropriate
5. ✅ Update speaker notes with validated data
