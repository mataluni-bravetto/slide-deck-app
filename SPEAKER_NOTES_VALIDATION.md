## THE 12 INTERACTIVE SLIDES WITH CURSOR.AI DEMO INSTRUCTIONS

### PHASE 1: CLARIFY (Slides 1-8)

#### Slide 2: "AI Was Supposed to Make You Faster"
**INTERACTIVE INSTRUCTION:**
```
WHAT TO SAY: "AI was supposed to make you faster. Instead, you're losing 40+ hours per month."

HOW TO SAY IT: Direct, empathetic. Pause after each bullet.

INTERACTIVE MOMENT:
"Raise your hand if you've experienced 3 or more of these in the last month."
[Wait for response. Count hands. Acknowledge.]

DEMO: None (interactive only)
```

**YAGNI:** ✅ Essential bullets only  
**JØHN:** ✅ Math verified (10 hours/week × 4 = 40 hours/month)  
**Congruency:** ✅ Aligns with problem awareness phase  
**Harmony:** ✅ Sets up complementarity insight  

---

#### Slide 4: "AI Out-Recurses You. You Out-Reason AI."
**INTERACTIVE INSTRUCTION:**
```
WHAT TO SAY: "AI excels at depth and speed, pattern saturation, brute-force variants, exploring edge cases, generating scaffolds. You excel at intent and direction, constraints and trade-offs, choosing what matters, weighing risks, defining 'good enough'."

HOW TO SAY IT: Read left column quickly (AI speed), then right column slowly (human deliberation). Show the contrast.

INTERACTIVE MOMENT:
"Which column resonates more with your daily experience? Left or right?"
[Pause for reflection. Listen to responses.]

DEMO: None (interactive only)
```

**YAGNI:** ✅ Perfect two-column complementarity  
**JØHN:** ✅ Conceptually accurate  
**Congruency:** ✅ Core insight of complementarity  
**Harmony:** ✅ Visual separation reinforces message  

---

#### Slide 5: "The $18,000 Question"
**INTERACTIVE INSTRUCTION:**
```
WHAT TO SAY: "At $50/hour, 40 hours/month = $2,000/month = $24,000/year. Even if you're only losing 30 hours/month, that's $18,000/year in lost productivity. This is real money. This is fixable."

HOW TO SAY IT: Slow, deliberate. Let the numbers sink in.

INTERACTIVE MOMENT:
"What's your hourly rate? [Pause] Multiply by 30. That's your monthly cost. Multiply by 12. That's your annual cost. This is real money."
[Give them 30 seconds to calculate. Ask a few to share.]

DEMO: None (interactive only)
```

**YAGNI:** ✅ Clear math, no fluff  
**JØHN:** ✅ Math verified ($50/hour × 30 hours × 12 months = $18,000)  
**Congruency:** ✅ Makes cost tangible  
**Harmony:** ✅ Gold highlight draws attention

7. Pause. "See the difference? Intent. Constraints. Validation."

EXACT CURSOR PROMPT:
```

HOW TO SAY IT: Contrast the chaos with the structure.

CURSOR.AI DEMO - CHATTING VS GUIDING CONTRAST:
1. Show CHATTING: Multiple unrelated prompts, backtracking, context lost
2. Pause. "See the chaos? No structure. No source of truth."
3. Show GUIDING: Single source of truth, every call references it
4. Show prompt: [Use exact prompt below]
5. Show result: [Structured, aligned, validated]

EXACT CURSOR PROMPT:
```
