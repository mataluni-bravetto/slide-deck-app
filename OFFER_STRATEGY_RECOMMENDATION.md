**Current Slideshow:**
- Focus: Guardian Convergence Loop (workflow methodology)
- Offer: 30-Day Convergence Sprint (implied paid)
- Positioning: Workflow transformation, general dev focus
- Deliverables: Now includes guide, checklist, toolkit (after integration)

**Input Structure:**
- 20-slide deck with detailed speaker notes
- Same pattern: Clarify → Align → Converge → Transform → Invite
- Natural, non-pushy offer structure
- Three paths: Solo, Sprint, Team

### **Key Insight**
You have **two complementary products** that need unified positioning:
1. **Validation Toolkit** (what to check) - Landing page focus
2. **Convergence Loop** (how to guide) - Slideshow focus

**The Bridge:** Validation is Step 4 of the Convergence Loop. Toolkit implements validation. Loop teaches methodology.
